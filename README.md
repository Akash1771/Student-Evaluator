# Student-Evaluator
# Student Academic Performance Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict students' final grades based on various features, including attendance, study habits, and socio-economic factors. The project utilizes Python and popular libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate students' academic performance based on different contributing factors. This model can help educators identify students who may need additional support to improve their grades.

## Features

- Predicts final grades using multiple features.
- Utilizes Linear Regression for modeling.
- Includes data visualization to compare actual vs predicted grades.

## Dataset

A synthetic dataset was created for this project with the following features:

- **Attendance**: Attendance rate (0 to 1)
- **Study_Hours**: Hours spent studying per week (1 to 10)
- **Socio_Economic_Status**: Categorical variable indicating socio-economic status (Low, Medium, High)
- **Final_Grade**: Final grades (0 to 100)

In a real-world scenario, this dataset would be replaced with an actual dataset of students' records.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
